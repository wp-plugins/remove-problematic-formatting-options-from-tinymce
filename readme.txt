Removes those extra-tempting but extra-problematic buttons from tinyMCE, like font color, alignment, and other things that will wreck your style sheet.

In addition, it removes "Heading 1" from the role dropdown, as there should never be more than one H1 on a page -- and the page or post title is already it.

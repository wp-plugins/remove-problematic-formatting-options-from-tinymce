== Description ==
Removes those extra-tempting but extra-problematic buttons from tinyMCE, like font color, alignment, and other things that will wreck your style sheet.

In addition, it removes "Heading 1" from the role dropdown, as there should never be more than one H1 on a page -- and the page or post title is already it.

= Why Does Formatting Matter? =

When people first get their hands on that shiny WordPress text editor, they often get swept up in the excitement of styling their text. “This is important, so I’ll make it red! And this part will be centered, and this part will use giant letters…”

But as fun as this is, there’s a way to use the WordPress text composer like a pro, and the benefits of doing it in that way are big:

* **Better potential rankings** on search engines (Search Engine Optimization)
* A consistent look across your whole website and other materials (research shows that visual consistency leads to **trust**)
* Better **flexibility** across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones
* Better **accessibility** for readers with a wide range of disabilities.
* Better **maintainability** when it comes to future site updates — that means savings!
* What’s the secret sauce that provides all these benefits?

**Mark your text with what it is, not what it should look like**.

= What does that mean? =

It means that your website already has a style guide built into it, so that it knows that a subtitle looks a certain way — perhaps it is larger, bold, or a different color than the main text. **So when you type in a subtitle, you only need to let WordPress know that it’s a subtitle, and the rest will be taken care of. Do not give in to the temptation** to mark the subtitle text as bold, larger, centered or a different color from the WordPress editor.

This plugin removes the most damaging buttons from the Wordpress editor, so you (or your clients) won't be tempted to use them.
